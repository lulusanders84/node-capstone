<p>Easily accessible and well organized information is crucial to provding safe and effcient nursing care. Nurses keep track and exhange information with the help of a nursing report (known as a brainsheet). Traditionally handwritten, the report is updated frequently during the shift and used as an information source. Nursing Reports provides an electronic version of a nursing brainsheet.</p>

## Unit List

<p>After signing in, the user is taken to the unit list which contains a list of all patients on their unit. The demo user is a nurse on the 
Cardiovascular Medical Unit. From the unit list, the user selects patients to add to their assignment list. The user can add patients to the unit list from a button in the dropdown menu. Patients are removed from the unit list the day after his or her discharge date. Any user can view the patient reports from the unit list. This functionality is important so another nurse can add information on patients not on their assignment list.</p>

## Assignment List

Each user has an assignment list of patients added from the larger unit list. The assignment list makes it easier for the user to access the patient reports he or she needs as they don't have to navigate the larger unit list. The user can remove patients from their assignment list from this page. Users click 'view' to go to his or her patient reports.

## Patient Reports

Each element of the patient report is editable so the user can update as information changes. The patient report gives the user a place to keep track of information on each of his or her patients. The patient report fields are contained within a collapsable menu. There are buttons to conveniently show the entire report or hide the entire report. From the dropdown menu the user can go back to their assignment list or to the unit list.
